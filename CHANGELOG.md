<a name="v1.0.0"></a>
## v1.0.0
* the very old items (pre v0.5.0) have been removed, so if you still had some of those, they are gone when you load v1.0.0 - you shouldn't have any of them unless you stashed them away for over 6 months.
* Documentation (README) was rewritten and old information removed as well as new information added
* you won't be able to download the Campaign with the mod anymore, there is a .bat you can use to copy the Levels.arc into the mod folder, more information on this is in the new Readme

### Expansion
* *AoM:* Inquisitor and Necromancer have been added
* new Monsters added to DGA spawn pools
* Devotion cap and Level cap changed to the new AoM cap 
* other changes like XP equations, etc changed to the AoM values
* anything I have missed will be fixed later, since I havn't played the Expansion without a mod I can't tell if everything is right (are bosses missing or is something not happening as it should)

### Major Features
* Added Planes-Shifters (aka "Leveling") Gear for levels 85 and 100 where Level 100 Gear is rather expansive compared to the rest. It's quite possible I'll have to make some nerfs to higher gear, I havn't checked with the new items and the scaling algorithm I'm using for them.
* Pylons can now spawn in the Campaign

#### Personal Assistant
* You can get a Scroll from the Settings Ghost (in DGA) or Jailor (Main Campaign)
* that Scroll will summon a ghost when used with several options

![Personal Assistant - Conversation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20875155/32143862-8bd938c0-bcb0-11e7-9de9-41a2d3b1e11b.jpg "Personal Assistant - Conversation")

#### [Legendary Crafting](http://www.grimdawn.com/forums/showthread.php?t=57005)
* Vanilla Epics and Legendaries can be crafted at a new Blacksmith (accessible through the new Personal Assistant)
  * it's a long list, it may take a moment to load and I recommend collapsing everything and only expand the type you want to craft
* They can be crafted for Legendary Essences (from Omega Mod) and Iron Bits
* Dismantling Legendaries will give you Legendary Essences.
  * Epics have a lower chance
* Update from the initial Release of the Standalone version:
  * minor Blueprint cleanup
  * Blacksmiths have been changed to only show these new Blueprints
  * Blacksmiths have the same bonuses as the Gifts & Treasures Blacksmiths (= crafted Legendaries can be slightly better due to an affix being rolled on it)
  
### Minor Features
* Organized Settings NPC a little. e.g. Difficulties are now in a new Sub-Conversation.
* Instead of Salvaging Common Items at the Ghost or Jailor you can now use the Personal Assistant for that and the conversation for it has been replaced to give you the Scroll to summon the Assistant
* DGA Challenge Enemies have been changed to regular enemy strength (it adds too many additional files especially with AoM Enemies = not fun to build the mod when it takes over 3 minutes each time I need to work on it)
* DGA Legendary Drop-Rates increased by roughly 50% more than the AoM increase

### Bug Fixes
* Difficulty could not be set to higher than Elite, it now goes all the way up to Legendary as it's supposed to
